# weibo2tumblr
A serverless function to cross-post from Sina Weibo to Tumblr

## Motivation

On the Sina weibo, it is fairly common for your tweet/retweet to be deleted by mods or original poster. Thus I would be great to have a tool that simultaneously sync your post to another microblog platform.

## Why cross-post to tumblr(not twitter)?

1. Tumblr supports uploading multiple photos in a single post, so your weibo retweet with mulitple photos could be display in a single tumblr post.

2. Tumblr supports html in the post, so all html parsed in Sina weibo content could be used directly in the tumblr post.

3. Since it supports html in the post, you can easily use embed to display videos(from streamable) in the post. This means we can also sync video post between Sina weibo and tmublr.
